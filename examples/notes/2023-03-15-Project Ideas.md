# Project Ideas

Here are some project ideas I've been thinking about:

1. Create a tool for extracting insights from conversations
   - Process iMessage, Skype, and other chat data
   - Use LLMs to identify key ideas and concepts
   - Organize by topic and relevance

2. Build a habit tracking app with social accountability
   - Connect with friends for accountability
   - Gamify habit building with streak tracking
   - Provide insights on habit formation patterns

3. Personal knowledge management system
   - Automatically tag and categorize notes
   - Link related concepts
   - Integrate with various data sources
   - Visualization of knowledge connections

4. Community volunteer matching platform
   - Match volunteers with opportunities based on skills
   - Track impact metrics
   - Provide recognition for contributions

Need to research tech stacks for each of these ideas, but leaning toward TypeScript + Next.js as a foundation.
